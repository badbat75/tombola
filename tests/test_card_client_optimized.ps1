Write-Host "=========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`n📋 Test Summary:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "✅ Server request optimization: Card data and game ID fetched once, cached during session"

Write-Host "cargo run --bin tombola-player --nocard 3        # Request 3 cards during registration"
Write-Host "cargo run --bin tombola-player --name 'TestUser' # Use custom client name"
